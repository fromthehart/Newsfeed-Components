      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Lambda School, a big part of our job is finding and providing new tools and
          opportunities for our students to stay engaged, inspired and excited about pushing themselves beyond what they
          thought was possible in their work, their lives and themselves.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&rsquo;s why today, we are very excited to announce a partnership with
        </span><a href="https://pioneer.app"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pioneer.</span></a></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pioneer is an online game for productivity. Players enroll with a project, then
          spend 30 days trying to accumulate as many points as possible by demonstrating rapid progress on it.
        </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Points are awarded through a few mechanisms, but they are predominantly based
          on peer voting: the more impressive your progress is to the other applicants, the better you'll fare. </span>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pioneer has created an unique competition and custom leaderboard, specifically
          for current full time Lambda School students: <a
            href="https://pioneer.app/lambdaschool">https://pioneer.app/lambdaschool</a>.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entrants can submit a current project they are working on &nbsp;or pick a new
          one.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the competition closes at the end of April, the </span><b>top five
          finishers, will be awarded $18,000 ($2,000 per month/for nine months) for use towards their living costs while
          they are enrolled as full time Lambda School students. </b></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enrolling is simple and only takes a few minutes. Here&rsquo;s how:</span></p>
      <ul>

      <h2>Announcing Living Stipends for Lambda School Students</h2>
      <p class="date">Mar 12th, 2019</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today is a day I’ve been looking forward to since before Lambda School started,
          and one I wasn’t sure would ever come to fruition.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also feels very, very personal to me.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
      <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting with Nothing</span></h2>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I came to Silicon Valley from Utah I didn’t have much to offer the world.
          I had no skills, no credentials, and practically no money. I didn’t even have enough to pay for a single
          month’s rent.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I knew I had to be a part of the future, and I was willing to do whatever
          it took to get there. So I packed up a few of my things, gave the rest away, and <a
            href="https://www.quora.com/Would-becoming-homeless-be-a-good-strategy-to-cut-costs-1/answer/Austen-Allred?fbclid=IwAR1ypB8OVbtMD9LE0mkp17iNEwTNcUfoT6hSJWVhaDH9J6Fx1qu21EEBNuY">lived
            in a two-door Honda Civic</a> in Palo Alto. I learned how to be discreet in wealthy neighborhoods, how to
          store food to not rot in the hot interior of a car, and most of all I learned to cope with the sheer
          desperation of being a breath away from destitution while continuing to fight for a better future.</span><span
          style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We started Lambda School for people like me - believing that if we could invest
          in people to make them more successful it wouldn’t be hard for them to pay the investment back.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
      <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access</span></h2>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the concern of nearly every finance mind we could talk to and anyone
          who had ever started a school, we created a world-class school accessible from anywhere and free until hired.
          Now we’re watching the effect that has on thousands of students, many of whom are just as brilliant and
          hard-working as any of the billionaires I’ve met in Silicon Valley. After years of our entire team struggling
          day and night it’s actually working.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even as we expanded access to those folks, we found that for too many the
          $0 tuition was only a start, there was the question of how to pay bills while going to school full time.
          Parents, providers with mouths to feed, and folks everywhere who couldn’t buy enough time to learn the skills
          that would make their time more valuable in the first place.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today we’re excited to remove yet another barrier for yet another set of
          people.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
      <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lambda School Living Stipend Pilot</span></h2>
      <h3><strong>Starting today, we’re going to pay students accepted for the stipend $2,000/month for 9 months so they
          can learn the highest-paying skills in the world.</strong></h3>
      <h3><strong>And they will only pay us back if they land a job that pays $50k/yr or more.</strong></h3>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they do secure that kind of income, they’ll pay Lambda School 10% of their
          income for 5 years, so we can continue to pay it forward to the next student.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means Lambda School is now offering world-class instruction, deep
          curriculum, a community of fellow learners, industry mentors, career coaches, hiring partners, interview
          sourcers, and now we’re going to begin giving people cold hard cash.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve been piloting this successfully at a smaller scale, and while we still
          won’t be able to serve everyone who stands in need we’re excited to watch this change the lives of many
          people. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we continue to prove that this model works we can begin putting millions
          (and hopefully soon billions) of dollars behind it.</span></p>

      <p><a href="https://lambdaschool.com/stipend">Prospective students can apply for the living stipend
          here.</a>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><a href="https://lambdaschool.typeform.com/to/YOY4Xo">Current students can apply for a living stipend here.</a>
      </p>
      <h2><b>FAQS: Lambda’s Living Stipend Program:</b></h2>
      <h3><b>What is the Lambda Living Stipend Pilot Program?</b></h3>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lambda School will be offering both current and prospective students the
          opportunity to apply for a total of $18K USD in financing to support their living expenses while they are
          enrolled as full time Lambda School students. </span></p>
      <h3><b>Why is Lambda School trying to launch this?</b></h3>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our goal at Lambda School is to help our student really succeed to the best of
          their ability and to remove the barriers that are currently preventing more people from being able to access a
          high tech education - and the career, financial, impact and other benefits that come with it. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that one of the hardest parts of deciding to go back to school is
          figuring out how to make it work without a full time salary.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By launching this Living Stipend Pilot Program, we are looking at how we can
          create more products and innovative ways to help support our current students - and to expand who can become a
          Lambda School student.</span></p>
      <h3><b>How will it operate?</b></h3>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students who are selected will receive $18,000 USD paid in nine monthly
          payments of $2,000 USD for the duration of the full time nine month program.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To continue to receive the stipend students have to maintain full time status
          and the 100% sprint pass rate expected from all Lambda School students - regardless of whether they are
          receiving a living stipend.</span></p>
      <h3><b>Who can apply for the stipend?</b></h3>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This program is open to current and prospective full time Lambda School
          students who are living in and eligible to work in the United States.</span></p>
      <h3><b>Do students then pay back the money?</b></h3>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, this is a stipend and not a scholarship.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon completion of the nine month program students will be required to pay 10%
          of their salary for 5 years. The stipend is built into that amount.</span></p>
      <h3><b>But how does this work with my education ISA?</b></h3>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Lambda School tuition Income Share Agreement has students on a repayment
          plan of 17% for two years.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For students who receive the living stipend as well, this becomes 10% of their
          salary for five years and replaces the model above.</span></p>
      <h3><b>What are the selection criteria?</b></h3>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will not be looking at student financials or credit scores.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Instead the applications will be screened using the following questions:
        </span></p>
      <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why do you need this living stipend to be successful as a Lambda School
            student?</span></i></p>
      <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell us a bit about the unique part of your story that will make you a
            valuable addition to both the Lambda and tech community? </span></i><b><br><br></b></p>
      <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell us why we should bet on you?</span></i></p>
      <h3><b>Who will be selecting the recipients?</b></h3>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our current Lambda School admissions team will be handling these stipend
          applications </span></p>
      <h3><b>How many students will receive the stipend?</b></h3>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a limited and selective pilot program and to launch we will be looking
          for our first 50 recipients.</span></p>
      <h3><b>Do recipients have to account for how they spend the money?</b></h3>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No</span></p>
      <h3><b>Will Lambda School be expanding this program, when?</b></h3>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, stay tuned for more details. </span></p>

      <h2>Lambda Mentor Program: Helping Students Build Local Personal Networks</h2>
      <p class="date">Feb 22nd, 2019</p>
      <p><img src="https://cdn.buttercms.com/3ufwz1bkQQuIlpehvWIa" alt="rawpixel-665384-unsplash.jpg"></p>
      <p>Today we're announcing the Lambda Mentor program, the best way to get involved with Lambda School by mentoring
        and spending time with students in your local area. Many students come to Lambda School with no network in
        technology. But we've learned that many folks in the broader community who follow Lambda School are among the
        best and brightest in their community, and have offered or are looking for ways to give back to help new
        developers and designers in their area. We want to help make that happen.</p>
      <p>We'll continue to build on the Lambda Mentor program, but today we're launching <strong>Weekly Checkins, a
          regular ~45 minute one-on-one with a new developer in your local area who's still attending classes to check
          in, give them feedback on their work, offer support, and help orient them to the tech community in your
          area</strong>.</p>
      <p>Bring your expertise and willingness to help someone new in your community, we'll provide an agenda, an e-mail
        summary of what the student's been working on, and suggested questions or discussion topics every week. Most
        meetings can take place on Zoom or over the phone, but we would love for students to start building their
        in-person local network as well, so meeting in real life occasionally is encouraged.</p>
      <p>Everyone can think of a few key people in life that got them where they are, this is your best chance to be
        that person for someone who needs it.</p>
      <p>We're building a pilot group of 35 mentors willing to work with at least one student per week as we experiment
        and prove the model. Once we have a consistent, repeatable, reliable experience for mentors and students alike,
        we'll expand the program to support as much of our student body as possible.</p>
      <h2>Q&amp;A</h2>
      <p><b>What do I get for becoming a Lambda Mentor?</b></p>
      <p>The first group of Lambda Mentors will be extremely important in helping us build a next-level experience for
        all of our students. To recognize that, we'll be featuring Lambda Mentors on our upcoming Mentors page, adding
        regular shoutouts in our newsletter and social media, inviting mentors to our internal Lambda Slack community,
        and creating exclusive Lambda Mentor swag.</p>
      <p><b>How else can I get involved?</b></p>
      <p>We've had hundreds of people ask us how they can get involved helping students in their local area, but we know
        a weekly one-on-one is not the right fit for everyone.</p>
      <p>We're experimenting with other ways to build hyper-local in-person networks for our students, including
        sponsoring meetups, casual nights of code at coffee shops, and office tours. We want to provide the venue, the
        drinks, the food, the agenda, or whatever else it takes to help build these local communities. We're still
        exploring the right way to do so, and would love your input. Send us your feedback and ideas&nbsp;on Twitter, or
        e-mail <a href="mailto:mentor@lambdaschool.com">mentor@lambdaschool.com</a>.</p>
      <p><b>What's the commitment here?</b></p>
      <p>For the one-on-one weekly checkin, we're hoping for 45-60 minutes a week at a consistent time.</p>
      <p><b>How many students would I be working with?</b></p>
      <p>We expect most mentors will start with one or two students that live or want to work in their local area. Our
        students are spread pretty evenly across the United States. Bigger metropolitan areas will have a few dozen
        students, while smaller cities may not have any yet. If we have more students and you want to work with them,
        we'd love that. But no pressure.</p>
      <p>If you're interested, sign up and we'll get in touch with some more specifics about students in your area right
        away.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>How do I get started?</b></p>
      <p>We're just building out the program, but we're taking signups now and hope to start meetings with our pilot
        group of Lambda Mentors in the next two weeks. Go ahead and follow the link below to sign up.</p>
      <h2>Sign Up</h2>

      <h2>Lambda Part-Time: Better Projects, Extended Courses, New Time Zones</h2>
      <p class="date">Feb 7th, 2019</p>
      <p><img src="https://cdn.buttercms.com/5BUuhitGTx6qJiWLr4Nh" alt="bonnie-kittle-186235-unsplash.jpg"></p>
      <p>Last week we announced that we were <a
          href="https://medium.com/lambda-school-blog/lambda-updates-integrated-career-search-farewell-to-graduation-and-9-month-classes-312ced2c2ed2">doubling
          down on student outcomes</a> by integrating our careers curriculum and job search directly into class,
        eliminating graduation, and extending our full-time courses to 9 months. This week we're excited to announce
        some new changes to bring the same relentless focus on student outcomes to our part-time programs.</p>
      <h3 id="syncingupnewfulltimeprogramstoparttime">Syncing Up New Full-time Programs to Part-Time</h3>
      <p>Our stance on part-time programs is that there should be zero asterisks next to a part-time graduate vs a
        full-time graduate. So when we planned out the class, we doubled the length of the course to make sure students
        had the same number of class sessions, projects, code challenges, etc. We use the same curriculum, same
        projects, same structure.&nbsp;The only difference is the schedule.</p>
      <p>When we announce any new change to our full-time programs, one of the first questions we get is "how will this
        affect part-time?". Excited to share a few more specifics in this post. Specifically, how we're bringing Build
        Weeks, Lambda Labs, and our new integrated job search into the program.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Build Weeks</em></strong>. We're kicking off the pilot of Build Weeks with part-time on Monday.
        Project sprints in part-time used to last one week. With the new Build Week model, we're moving to two weeks, so
        students are able to have the full experience and build the same level of project in our flexible evening class
        schedule.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Lambda Labs</em></strong>. We're moving Lambda Labs forward from the end of class to the middle of
        class. That means part-time students will take nearly three months to build a group project before entering the
        Computer Science portion of class. Just like full-time, students will begin their job search after completing
        Labs, approximately 9 months into the program.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Integrated Job Search</em></strong>. Students will begin working with our Careers team on regular
        workshops about one month after beginning class.</p>
      <h3 id="flexiblefifthday">Flexible Fifth Day</h3>
      <p>Our part-time classes run Monday-Thursday, 6-9PM Pacific, and Saturday mornings from 9AM-12PM Pacific. The
        fifth day of class has always been more of a challenge for many students to commit to.</p>
      <p>Today we're announcing that <strong>we're making the Saturday morning session flexible</strong>. Soon students
        across our part-time programs will be able to choose Friday evening, Saturday morning, Saturday afternoon, or
        Sunday morning, to best fit their schedule.</p>
      <p>Because we're keeping the same Saturday time slot, nothing changes for current students unless they opt-in to a
        better time for them. We're really excited to be able to make this a more flexible option for our students who
        need it.</p>
      <h3 id="extendedcourselength">Extended Course Length</h3>
      <p>In order to accomodate the new full-length Build Weeks sprints, <strong>we're extending the posted course
          length to 14 months</strong>. Students will be able to opt-in to a full 18 month version of class that allows
        for 4 additional months of job search, but will not be required to do so.</p>
      <p>Students in part-time will begin their job search 9 months into the program, so they'll have plenty of built in
        time to reinforce their skills and search for jobs within the 14 month schedule. But for those who need the
        additional time, we're making it available.</p>
      <h3 id="newstartdates">New Start Dates and Time Zones</h3>
      <p>Our part-time class is incredibly popular. Later this month students who need the more flexible schedule will
        make up nearly half of our student body. In order to make class even more flexible, we're adding start dates in
        an all new time zone to better support students living in the Central and Eastern time zones.</p>
      <p>In the short-term we're adding a new March 18th start date. <strong>Moving forward we'll have start dates every
          five weeks, aligning with our full-time start dates</strong>. (In addition to other benefits, that means
        students will be able to seamlessly switch between full-time or part-time if their work situation changes.)</p>
      <p><strong>Each start date will alternate between running on Pacific and Central time zones</strong>. March 18th
        will be our first Central time cohort, April 22 will run on Pacific time, May 28th on Central, etc.
        Monday-Thursday 6PM-9PM + Flexible Fifth (choose either Friday evening, Saturday Morning, Saturday Afternoon, or
        Sunday Morning).&nbsp;</p>
      <p>So if you live on the East Coast and have been waiting for Lambda School to offer part-time classes that don't
        run until midnight, this one's for you.</p>
      <h3 id="noasterisks">No Asterisks</h3>
      <p>When we decided to launch a part-time course, nearly half of our team at Lambda School had been involved in
        teaching evenings and weekend classes. Most fell short with miserable completion rates, and short-changed
        students. Take a look, many schools label their part-time classes to make sure folks don't have the same
        expectations as they would taking a full-time class. Our instruction team refused to run a part-time program
        until we addressed those issues. A part-time student should have every skill, every project, every opportuntiy
        that a full-time student does. No asterisks.</p>
      <p>These changes help us ensure we can continue to do that.</p>

      <h2>Lambda School Signs Partnership Agreement with CodeDoor</h2>
      <p class="date">Feb 6th, 2019</p>
      <p><b>Pleasanton, California —</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> On the heels of their recent Series B
          fundraising announcement, Lambda School has just signed a partnership agreement with CodeDoor, a German-based
          nonprofit providing scholarships in coding to women, migrants, and refugees. This partnership will enable
          CodeDoor students to become software engineers by joining one of Lambda’s recently-launched EU cohorts and
          receiving tutoring and career coaching from CodeDoor’s talented staff. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our two organizations compliment each other incredibly well, so we’re thrilled
          to make this official and start providing new career opportunities for even more students in Germany and
          beyond,” said Aaron Neuenschwander, Head of Strategic Partnerships at Lambda School.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the agreement, CodeDoor will help identify and prepare interested
          students for one of Lambda School’s available EU cohorts. Once students are enrolled into Lambda School
          they’ll be able to lean on CodeDoor tutors for support in difficult concepts. &nbsp;They’ll also receive
          additional career coaching and networking opportunities from CodeDoor. CodeDoor has deep and respected
          connections in the European tech industry, ones that will afford Lambda students even more employment
          opportunities.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img
            src="https://cdn.buttercms.com/caFl3UKBRwGJqVd21DIo" alt="CodeDoor_Engineering_Students.jpeg"></span><span
          style="font-weight: 400;"></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students hard at work at CodeDoor in
            Munich</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lambda School’s business model has opened up doors to students who previously
          could not pursue a world-class technical education due to a number of factors, including cost and location. In
          much the same way, CodeDoor has facilitated economic mobility and social integration for individuals from
          underprivileged and underserved communities. These largely untapped communities in the tech sector could play
          a big role in narrowing the skills gap which currently exists in the marketplace.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see this partnership as being a very important piece to ensure we hit our
          goal of helping 1,000 women and other untapped groups launch a new tech career within three years,” said Karan
          Dehghani, Founder of CodeDoor. CodeDoor recently launched the aforementioned initiative entitled Code1000 -
          with the goal of helping 1,000 individuals launch a new career in technology. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the CodeDoor students who want to get into computing jobs are highly
          skilled and motivated individuals, but they simply haven’t had appropriate opportunities. While some of the
          students have previous tech experience, there is no prerequisite of a tech background or college degree to
          join their program (nor is it for Lambda School students). CodeDoor and Lambda School are searching for
          individuals with an aptitude towards learning and using technology, who exhibit an ambition to pursue a career
          in the ever-changing tech sector.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The combined strengths of Lambda School and CodeDoor will make this partnership
          a solid and steady pipeline of talent for EU employers. If you’re interested in learning more about the
          partnership, please reach out to Nora Schimang, </span><span

      <h2>Integrated Career Search, Farewell to Graduation, and 9 Month Classes</h2>
      <p class="date">Jan 31st, 2019</p>
      <p><img src="https://cdn.buttercms.com/10hvuieeTq2GlX0CUCtf" alt="lambda collage.jpg"></p>
      <p>When we started Lambda School we wanted to build the most outcomes-driven school in the world. Our first value
        at Lambda School reads: <b>Student Obsessed – We are relentless in pursuit of student outcomes.</b></p>
      <p>We've gotten a pretty good start over the past 18 months. We've hired&nbsp;<a
          href="https://lambdaschool.com/company/">world class instructors and instructional designers</a>, we launched
        <a
          href="https://lambdaschool.com/blog/introducing-lambda-next-our-revolutionary-new-job-search-and-placement-program/">Lambda
          Next</a> – our full-time alumni career support program that sticks with students until they're in a job they
        love, <a href="https://twitter.com/austenallred/status/1069584101815013377">Build Weeks</a> – where students
        from various cohorts of the school work together to build production-ready applications, Principles for Success
        – our weekly career readiness workshops designed to teach the non-technical skills that separate the
        inexperienced from professionals, and recently announced&nbsp;<a
          href="https://lambdaschool.com/blog/introducing-lambda-async-our-way-to-guarantee-student-job-readiness/">Async</a>
        – our mastery-based progression program, where students are able to work on every concept until they have
        mastered it.</p>
      <p>Today we’re doubling down on student outcomes with three announcements – we're integrating the job search
        directly into our curriculum, replacing graduation with job celebrations, and extending the posted course length
        to nine months.&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Change One: The job hunt now happens <i>during</i> Lambda School, not after it</h2>
      <p>Like students at most schools, Lambda School students have gone through three stages:</p>
      <ol>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;">Learn</li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;">Graduate</li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;">Look for a job</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Unfortunately, life changes after graduation in a couple of difficult ways. The extrinsic motivation and social
        accountability that propels a student through challenging coursework disappears. The concrete daily schedule
        becomes completely open. Support from friends and family dries up. At the end of the day, despite new skills and
        ambition to get started in their new career, many students have to find work of any kind immediately, often
        resorting to Uber, a temp job with a friend, or the same job they had before class.&nbsp;All too often, those
        students fall out of practice, and for every passing day it becomes harder to get into the first new job.</p>
      <p>So we're integrating the job search into the course.&nbsp;Students will begin working with our Careers team
        within a month of starting class, working on their portfolio, building their network, and creating their job
        search plan. They'll work through our new series of Career and Professional Development workshops spread across
        the course. They'll build their first team capstone projects in&nbsp;<a
          href="https://lambdaschool.com/blog/how-lambda-school-labs-works-whiteboard-friday/">Lambda Labs,</a>&nbsp;our
        internal apprenticeship program, about halfway through class. And then they'll begin their job search in earnest
        working with their assigned Career Coach. All the while, they'll be participating in our Company Presentations
        series, where hiring managers with open positions from companies like The New York Times, Uber, and Etsy recruit
        students in private presentation and Q&amp;A sessions.</p>
      <p>All of these changes are made in the hope that <b>many students will be hired before completion of Lambda
          School</b>.</p>
      <h2>Change Two: Graduation will be replaced with Job Celebrations</h2>
      <p>Graduation is an outmoded tradition that serves as a false finish line for students and the school. Tradition
        tells graduates that the learning is over, and tells the school that the job is done. Neither of these are true
        at Lambda School.&nbsp;So <strong>to keep our eye on the real destination we're trading graduation ceremonies
          for job celebrations</strong>. Every student will get their time in the limelight, but that will happen when
        they've reached the real goal of landing that first job.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>We're expanding on our tradition where&nbsp;<a
          href="https://twitter.com/LambdaSchool/status/1054418400896667650">students share their offer selfies when
          they accept a job</a>&nbsp;with a weekly schoolwide event to celebrate every newly hired student, giving each
        one the chance to share their story and advice with the entire school.&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Change Three: Lambda School is now nine months full-time</h2>
      <p>In order to accommodate these and other curriculum changes, beginning in May <b>Lambda School's posted length
          will be nine months full-time</b>. The part-time length will be adjusted accordingly.</p>
      <p>Some students will be hired sooner, while others will study the full nine months. Now, however, a student can
        plan on a set amount of time to attend Lambda School <i>and</i> land a job, instead of a finite amount of time
        to attend Lambda School and an unknown amount of time afterwards.</p>
      <p>Importantly, a Lambda School student will end up with 1,500-2,000 hours of training. Because we are working
        full-time and more every day, Lambda School students will spend a similar amount of time&nbsp;during their nine
        months at Lambda School as a Computer Science student would during the CS-focused portion of a four-year CS
        degree.</p>
      <p>We’re really happy that we’re able to make this happen with <strong>no change in cost to students</strong>. So
        you’ll be able to attend up to 9 months of Lambda School and pay nothing until you land a job making more than
        $50,000 a year, at which point you’d pay 17% of your income for two years, with the same maximum $30k cap.</p>
      <p>While our posted course length will change for everyone in May, current students will be able to opt-in to the
        nine month schedule right away.</p>
      <h2>We're just getting started</h2>
      <p>We have a lot of things we're very proud of at Lambda School, but we're <a
          href="https://twitter.com/AustenAllred/status/1069635938601656321">just getting started</a>. Come join us.</p>
